1\ ScreenCap.exe : A lightweight screenshot tool ("ScreenCap") developed by 'ftchan5'
                   (shout-outs to the developer)
                   - PyCast has been tested at user's acceptance level by using this
                     tool in complement with it
                   - Reason because ScreenCap retains all screenshots taken and displays
                     them as floating objects (with thin boarders) ontop your windows.
                     With this feature, you can keep track of which area on screen you 
                     have performed OCR.
