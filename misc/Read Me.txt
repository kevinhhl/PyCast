1\ ScreenCap.exe : A lightweight screenshot tool ("ScreenCap") developed by 'ftchan5'
                   - ScreenCap works well with Pycast, the reason because it retains
                     screenshots taken and displays them as floating objects ontop your
                     screen until you choose to dismiss them. With this feature, you
                     can keep track of which area on screen you have performed OCR.
